This is the official user's guide for Stan.  It provides example
models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.

- Part 1 gives Stan code and discussions for several important classes
of models.

- Part 2 discusses various general Stan programming techniques that are
not tied to any particular model.

- Part 3 introduces algorithms for calibration and model checking that
require multiple runs of Stan.

- The appendices provide an introduction to the stanc3 compiler used in the
  various interfaces to Stan, a style guide, and advice for users of BUGS and
  JAGS.

In addition to this user's guide, there are two reference manuals for
the Stan language and algorithms.  The [*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
specifies the Stan programming language and inference algorithms. The
[*Stan Functions Reference*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html)
specifies the functions built into the Stan programming language.

There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each of the Stan [interfaces](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/) (R, Python,
Julia, Stata, MATLAB, Mathematica, and command line).

We recommend working through this guide using the textbooks _Bayesian
Data Analysis_ and _Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with
Examples in R and Stan_ as references on the concepts, and using the
[*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
when necessary to clarify programming issues.
