This is the official user's guide for Stan.  It provides example
models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.

- Part 1 gives Stan code and discussions for several important classes
of models.

- Part 2 discusses various general Stan programming techniques that are
not tied to any particular model.

- Part 3 introduces algorithms for calibration and model checking that
require multiple runs of Stan.

- The appendices provide an introduction to the stanc3 compiler used in the
  various interfaces to Stan, a style guide, and advice for users of BUGS and
  JAGS.

We recommend working through this guide using the textbooks _Bayesian
Data Analysis_ and _Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with
Examples in R and Stan_ as references on the concepts, and using the
[*Stan Reference Manual*](../reference-manual/overview.qmd)
when necessary to clarify programming issues.
