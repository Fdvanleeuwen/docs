# Extracting log probabilities and gradients for diagnostics

CmdStan can return the computed log probability and the gradient with respect to
a set of parameters.

This is similar to the `diagnose` subcommand, but the output format differs and
the results here are not compared with those from finite differences.

**Note**: Startup and data initialization costs mean that this method is not an
efficient way to calculate these quantities. It is provided only for
convenience and should not be used for serious computation.

## Configuration

This method takes 3 arguments:

- `jacobian` - Whether or not the Jacobian adjustment for constrained
  parameters should be included in the gradient. Default value is 1.

- `constrained_params` - Input file (JSON or R dump) of parameter values on
  constrained scale. These files are in the same format as those used in the
  `inits` argument for MCMC.

- `unconstrained_params` - Input file (JSON or R dump) of parameter values
  on unconstrained scale. These files should contain a single variable, called
  `params_r`, which is a flattened vector of all unconstrained parameters. If
  this object is two dimensional, each entry should be a vector of the same form and the output
  will feature multiple rows.

Only one of `constrained_params` and `unconstrained_params` should be specified.


## CSV output

The output file consists of the following pieces of information:

- The full set of configuration options available for the `variational` method is
reported at the beginning of the sampler output file as CSV comments.

- Column headers, the first column is labelled `lp__`, and the rest are named
  after parameters. These will be the unconstrained parameters, regardless of
  whether constrained or unconstrained parameters were supplied as input.

- Values which correspond to the value of the log density (column 1) and the
  gradient with respect to each parameter (remaining columns).

For example, if we have a file called params.json:

```json
{
    "theta" : 0.1
}
```

We can run the example model:

```
/bernoulli log_prob constrained_params=params.json data file=bernoulli.data.json
```

This yields


```

# stan_version_minor = 31
# stan_version_patch = 0
