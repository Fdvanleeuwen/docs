# `stanc`: Translating Stan to C++ {#stanc}

CmdStan translates Stan programs to C++ using the Stan compiler
program which is included in the CmdStan release `bin` directory as
program `stanc`.

As of release 2.22, the CmdStan Stan to C++ compiler is written in
OCaml. This compiler is called "stanc3" and has has its own
repository https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3, from which pre-built
binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows can be downloaded.


## Instantiating the `stanc` binary

Before the Stan compiler can be used, the binary stanc must be
created. This can be done using the makefile as follows. For Mac and
Linux:
```
make bin/stanc
```
For Windows:
```
make bin/stanc.exe
```


## The Stan compiler program

The Stan compiler program `stanc` converts Stan programs to C++ concepts.
If the compiler encounters syntax errors in the program,
it will provide an error message indicating the location
in the input where the failure occurred and reason for the failure.
The following example illustrates a fully qualified call to stanc to
generate the C++ translation of the example model `bernoulli.stan`.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```
For Windows:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc.exe --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```

The base name of the Stan program file determines the name of the C++ model class.
Because this name is the name of a C++ class, it must
start with an alphabetic character (`a--z` or `A--Z`) and
contain only alphanumeric characters (`a--z`, `A--Z`, and
`0--9`) and underscores (`_`) and should not conflict with
any C++ reserved keyword.

The C++ code implementing the class is written to the file
`bernoulli.hpp` in the current directory. The final argument,
`bernoulli.stan`, is the file from which to read the Stan
program.

In practice, stanc is invoked indirectly, via the GNU Make utility,
which contains rules that compile a Stan program to its corresponding
executable. To build the simple Bernoulli model via `make`, we specify
the name of the target executable file.
On Mac and Linux, this is the name of the Stan program with the `.stan`
omitted. On Windows, replace `.stan` with `.exe`, and make
sure that the path is given with slashes and not backslashes.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
For Windows:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe
```

The makefile rules first invoke the stanc compiler to translate the
Stan model to C++ , then compiles and links the C++ code to a binary
executable. The makefile variable `STANCFLAGS` can be used to to
override the default arguments to stanc, e.g.,
```
> make STANCFLAGS="--include-paths=~/foo" examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```

## Command-line options for stanc3 {#args}

The stanc3 compiler has the following command-line syntax:

```
> stanc (options) <model_file>
```
where `<model_file>` is a path to a Stan model
file ending in suffix `.stan`.

The stanc3 options are:

- `--help` - Displays the complete list of stanc3 options, then exits.

- `--version` - Display stanc version number

- `--info` - Print information about the model, such
as the type information for variables and the list of used distributions.

- `--name=<model_name>` - Specify the name of the class
used for the implementation of the Stan model in the generated C++ code.

- `--o=<file_name>` -  Specify the name of the file into
which the generated C++ is written.

- `--allow-undefined` - Do not throw a parser error
if there is a function in the Stan program
that is declared but not defined in the functions block.

- `--include_paths=<dir1,...dirN>` - Takes a comma-separated list
of directories that may contain a file in an `#include` directive.

- `--use-opencl` - If set, will use additional Stan OpenCL
features enabled in the Stan-to-C++ compiler.

- `--auto-format` - Pretty prints the program to the console.

- `--print-canonical` - Prints the canonicalized program to the console.

- `--print-cpp` - If set, output the generated C++ Stan model class to stdout.

- `--O` - Allow the compiler to apply all optimizations to the Stan
code. **WARNING:** _This is currently an experimental feature!_

- `--warn-uninitialized` - Emit warnings about uninitialized variables
to stderr. Currently an experimental feature.

- `--warn-pedantic` - Emit warnings in [Pedantic mode](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/pedantic-mode.html)
which warns of potential issues in the meaning of your program.

The compiler also provides a number of debug options which are
primarily of interest to stanc3 developers; use the `--help`
option to see the full set.

## Understanding stanc3 errors and warnings

During model compilation, stanc can produce a variety of errors (issues that
prevent the model from being compiled) and warnings (non-fatal issues that
should still be considered).

### Warnings

Even without the optional `--warn-pedantic` and `--warn-uninitialized` [command
line flags](#args), both of which enable additional warnings, stanc can still
produce warnings about your program. In particular, warnings will be produced
in two situations

1. A completely blank Stan program will produce the following warning message
   ```
   Warning: Empty file 'empty.stan' detected;
   this is a valid stan model but likely unintended!
   ```
2. The use of any [deprecated
   features](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/deprecated-features-appendix.html)
   will lead to warnings which will look as follows
   ```
   Warning in 'deprecated.stan', line 2, column 2:
   Comments beginning with # are deprecated.
   Please use // in place of # for line comments.
   ```

A single Stan program can produce many warnings during compilation.


### Errors

Errors differ from warnings in their severity and format. In particular, errors
are _fatal_ and stop compilation, so at most one error is displayed per run of
stanc.

There are four kinds of errors emitted by stanc3

1. File errors occur when the file passed to stanc is either missing or cannot
   be opened (i.e. has permissions issues). They look like
   ```
   Error: file 'notfound.stan' not found or cannot be opened
   ```
2. Syntatic errors occur whenever a program violates the Stan language's
   [syntax](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_27/reference-manual/language-syntax.html)
   requirements. There are three kinds of errors within syntax errors; "lexing"
   errors mean that the input was unable to be read properly on the character
   level, "include" errors which occur when the `#include` directive fails, and
   "parsing" errors which result when the structure of the program is incorrect.

   * The lexing errors occur due to the use of invalid characters in a program.
     For example, a lexing error due to the use of `$` in a variable name will
     look like the following.

     ```
     Syntax error in 'char.stan', line 2, column 6, lexing error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  data {
       2:     int $ome_variable;
                  ^
       3:  }
     -------------------------------------------------
     Invalid character found.
     ```

   * When an include directive is used, it can lead to errors if the included file
     is not found, or if a file includes itself (including a recursive loop of
     includes, such as A -> B -> A).

     ```
     Syntax error in './incl.stan', line 1, column 0, included from
     './incl.stan', line 1, column 0, included from
     'incl.stan', line 1, column 0, include error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  #include <incl.stan>
           ^
     -------------------------------------------------
     File incl.stan recursively included itself.
     ```

   * It is much more common to see parsing errors, which tend to have more
     in-depth explanations of the error found. For example, if a user forgets to
     put a size on a type like vector, as in the following, this raises a parsing
     (structural) error in the compiler.
     ```
     Syntax error in vec.stan', line 3, column 10 to column 11, parsing error:
     -------------------------------------------------
       1:  data {
       2:     int<lower=0> N;
       3:     vector x;
                     ^
       4:  }
     -------------------------------------------------
     "[" expression "]" expected for vector size.
     ```

3. Semantic errors (also known as type errors) occur when a program is stuctured
   correctly but features an error in the [type
   rules](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/extra-grammatical-constraints.html)
   imposed by the language. An example of this is assigning a real value to a
   variable defined as an integer.
   ```
   Semantic error in 'type.stan', line 2, column 3 to column 15:
   -------------------------------------------------
     1:  transformed data {
     2:     int x = 1.5;
            ^
     3:  }
   -------------------------------------------------
   Ill-typed arguments supplied to assignment operator =: lhs has
   type int and rhs has type real
   ```
4. Finally, the compiler can raise an internal error. These are caused by bugs
   in the compiler, **not** your model, and we would appreciate it if you report
   them on the [stanc3 repo](https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3/issues) with the
   error message provided. These errors usually say something like "This should
   never happen," and we apologize if they do.

## Using external C++ code

The `--allow_undefined` flag can be passed to the call to stanc,
which will allow undefined functions in the Stan language to be parsed
without an error. We can then include a definition of the function in
a C++ header file.
This requires specifying two makefile variables:
- `STANCFLAGS=--allow_undedefined`
- `USER_HEADER=<header_file.hpp>`, where `<header_file.hpp>` is the name of a header file that
defines a function with the same name and signature in a namespace
that is formed by concatenating the `class_name` argument to
stanc documented above to the string `_namespace`


As an example, consider the following variant of the Bernoulli example

```stan
functions {
  real make_odds(real theta);
}
data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  array[N] int<lower=0, upper=1> y;
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
}
model {
  theta ~ beta(1, 1); // uniform prior on interval 0, 1
  y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}
generated quantities {
  real odds;
  odds = make_odds(theta);
}
```
Here the `make_odds` function is declared but not defined, which
would ordinarily result in a parser error. However, if you put
`STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined` into the `make/local` file
or into the `stanc` call, then the stanc compiler will translate
this program to C++, but the generated C++ code will not compile
unless you write a file
such as `examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp` with the following lines
```
namespace bernoulli_model_namespace {
          template <typename T0__>  inline  typename
          boost::math::tools::promote_args<T0__>::type  make_odds(const T0__&
theta, std::ostream* pstream__) {
       return theta / (1 - theta);  }
       }
```
Given the above, the following `make` invocation should work
```
> make STANCFLAGS=--allow_undefined USER_HEADER=examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli # on Windows add .exe
```
Alternatively, you could put `STANCFLAGS` and `USER_HEADER` into the
`make/local` file instead of specifying them on the command-line.

If the function were more complicated and involved functions in the
Stan Math Library, then you would need to prefix the function calls
with `stan::math::`  The `pstream__` argument is mandatory
in the signature but need not be used if your function does not print
any output. To see the necessary boilerplate look at the corresponding
lines in the generated C++ file.

Library, see https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07164.
