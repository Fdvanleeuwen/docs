This is the reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.

The Stan project comprises a domain-specific language for
probabilistic programming, a differentiable mathematics and
probability library, algorithms for Bayesian posterior inference and
posterior analysis, along with interfaces and analysis tools in all of
the popular data analysis languages.

In addition to this reference manual, there is a user's guide and
a language reference manual for the Stan language and algorithms.
The [*Stan User's Guide*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html)
provides example models and programming
techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
The [*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
specifies the Stan programming language
and inference algorithms.

There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each of the Stan interfaces (R, Python, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, 
Mathematica, and command line).

#### Web resources {-}

Stan is an open-source software project, resources for which are
hosted on various web sites:

* The [Stan Web Site](https://mc-stan.org/) organizes all of the resources
for the Stan project for users and developers.  It contains links to
the official Stan releases, source code, installation instructions,
and full documentation, including the latest version of this manual,
the user's guide and the getting started guide for each interface,
tutorials, case studies, and reference materials for developers.

* The [Stan Forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org) provide structured
message boards for questions, discussion, and announcements related to
Stan for both users and developers.

* The [Stan GitHub Organization](https://github.com/stan-dev) hosts all
of Stan's code, documentation, wikis, and web site, as well as the
issue trackers for bug reports and feature requests and interactive
code review for pull requests.

#### Acknowledgements {-}

The Stan project could not exist without the generous grant
funding of many grant agencies to the participants in the project.
For more details of direct funding for the project, see the web site
and project pages of the Stan developers.

The Stan project could also not exist without the generous
contributions of its users in reporting and in many cases fixing bugs
in the code and its documentation.  We used to try to list all of
those who contributed patches and bug reports for the manual here, but
when that number passed into the hundreds, it became too difficult to
manage reliably.  Instead, we will defer to GitHub (link above), where
all contributions to the project are made and tracked.

Finally, we should all thank the Stan developers, without whom this
project could not exist.  We used to try and list the developers here,
but like the bug reporters, once the list grew into the dozens, it
became difficult to track.  Instead, we will defer to the Stan web
page and GitHub itself for a list of core developers and all developer
contributions respectively.
