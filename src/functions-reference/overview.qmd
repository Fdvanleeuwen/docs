This is the reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.

In addition to this reference manual, there is a user's guide and
a language reference manual for the Stan language and algorithms.

- The [**Stan User's Guide**](../stan-users-guide/overview.qmd)
provides example models and programming
techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.

- The [**Stan Reference Manual**](../reference-manual/overview.qmd)
specifies the Stan programming language
and inference algorithms.

- There are also separate installation and getting started guides for
[*CmdStan*](cmdstan-guide/overview.html), the command-line interface to the Stan inference engine,
and the R, Python, and Julia interfaces.
