This is the reference for the functions defined in the Stan math
library and available in the Stan programming language.

The Stan project comprises a domain-specific language for
probabilistic programming, a differentiable mathematics and
probability library, algorithms for Bayesian posterior inference and
posterior analysis, along with interfaces and analysis tools in all of
the popular data analysis languages.

In addition to this reference manual, there is a user's guide and
a language reference manual for the Stan language and algorithms.
The [*Stan User's Guide*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html)
provides example models and programming
techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.
The [*Stan Reference Manual*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/index.html)
specifies the Stan programming language
and inference algorithms.

There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each of the Stan interfaces (R, Python, Julia, Stata, MATLAB, 
Mathematica, and command line).
