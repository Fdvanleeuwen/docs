This is the official reference manual for Stan's *programming
language* for coding probability models, *inference algorithms* for
fitting models and making predictions, and *posterior analysis* tools
for evaluating the results.  This manual applies to all Stan
interfaces.

The first part of the reference manual provides a full specification
of the Stan programming language.  The language is
responsible for defining a log density function conditioned on data.
Typically, this is a Bayesian posterior, but it may also be a
penalized likelihood function.  The second part of the manual
specifies the inference algorithms and posterior inference tools.
The third part provides auxiliary information about the use of Stan.

In addition to this reference manual, the official documentation includes

- The [**Stan User's Guide**](stan-users-guide/overview.html) provides example models and programming techniques for coding statistical models in Stan.

- The [**Stan Functions Reference**](functions-reference/overview.html) specifies the functions built into the Stan programming language.

There are also separate installation and getting started guides for
[*CmdStan*](cmdstan-guide/overview.html), the command-line interface to the Stan inference engine,
and the R, Python, and Julia interfaces.
