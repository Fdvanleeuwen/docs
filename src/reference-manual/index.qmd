This is the official reference manual for Stan's *programming
language* for coding probability models, *inference algorithms* for
fitting models and making predictions, and *posterior analysis* tools
for evaluating the results.  This manual applies to all Stan
interfaces.

The first part of the reference manual provides a full specification
of the Stan programming language.  The language is
responsible for defining a log density function conditioned on data.
Typically, this is a Bayesian posterior, but it may also be a
penalized likelihood function.  The second part of the manual
specifies the inference algorithms and posterior inference tools.
The third part provides auxiliary information about the use of Stan.

There are two additional interface-neutral manuals, the
[*Stan Functions Reference*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html)
listing all the built-in functions and their signatures,
and the [*Stan User's Guide*](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html)
providing examples and programming techniques.
There is also a separate installation and getting started guide for
each interface.
